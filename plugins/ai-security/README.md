# AI-Security Plugin

**Comprehensive AI-powered security toolkit for Claude Code.** Intelligent security scanning, vulnerability detection, threat analysis, and secure development guidance.

---

## 🎯 What This Plugin Does

Provides a complete suite of AI-powered security tools including commands, agents, and skills that help you build secure applications, detect vulnerabilities, analyze threats, and maintain security best practices throughout your development lifecycle.

### Why Not Just Use `/security-review`?

Claude Code ships with a native `/security-review` command that provides basic security analysis. However, it has limitations:

❌ **No custom scan templates** - You can't define what the report should include
❌ **No output file control** - Results appear in chat but aren't saved to a specific location
❌ **No reproducibility** - Each scan produces different output formats
❌ **No standardization** - Can't ensure consistent audit documentation across projects

This plugin enhances security scanning by providing:

✅ **Custom scan templates** - Define exactly what your audit should cover
✅ **Controlled output location** - Reports saved to `/docs/security/{timestamp}-security-audit.md` (timestamp prevents overwrites)
✅ **Reproducible audits** - Same comprehensive format every time
✅ **Standardized documentation** - Consistent audit reports across all projects
✅ **Timestamped tracking** - Easy to compare audits over time
✅ **Enterprise-ready** - Professional audit documents suitable for compliance

**Use `/security-review` for:** Quick ad-hoc security checks during development

**Use `/security-audit` for:** Formal security audits, compliance documentation, and repeatable security assessments

## 📋 Available Commands

### `/security-init`

Initialize Claude Code security settings by automatically configuring `.claude/settings.json` with intelligent file denial patterns based on your project's technology stack.

**What it does:**

- 🔍 **Scans your project** to detect technologies (Node.js, Python, .NET, Go, Rust, PHP, Docker, etc.)
- 🛡️ **Builds comprehensive deny patterns** to prevent Claude Code from reading sensitive files:
  - Environment files (`.env`, `.env.*`)
  - Credentials and secrets (`credentials.json`, `secrets.yml`)
  - SSH keys and certificates (`*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`)
  - Cloud provider configs (`.aws/credentials`, `.gcp/*`)
  - Build artifacts (`node_modules`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `target/`, `vendor/`)
  - Version control and IDE files (`.git/`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- 🔄 **Smart merging** with existing settings (preserves your custom configurations)
- 📊 **Shows preview** before making changes
- ✅ **User confirmation** required before writing

**Before (manual):**

```
# Manually create .claude/settings.json
# Research what files should be denied
# Add patterns one by one
# Hope you didn't miss anything sensitive
```

**After (with ai-security plugin):**

```
/security-init
# ✨ AI detects your tech stack
# ✨ Builds comprehensive deny patterns (40-60+ patterns)
# ✨ Shows preview and asks for confirmation
# ✨ Merges with existing settings intelligently
# ✅ Security configured in seconds
# ⚠️  Restart Claude Code for settings to take effect
```

### `/security-audit`

Perform comprehensive security analysis on your codebase and generate a detailed audit report with vulnerability findings and remediation guidance.

**Note:** The `/security-audit` command will automatically check if you have proper file denial patterns configured. If you have fewer than 4 deny rules, it will recommend running `/security-init` first to ensure comprehensive protection.

**Before (manual):**

```
# Manual security review process
- Review each file for SQL injection patterns
- Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- Analyze authentication/authorization logic
- Review dependency vulnerabilities
- Check for hardcoded secrets
- Assess OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Write detailed findings document
- Create remediation plan
```

**After (with ai-security plugin):**

```
/security-audit
# ✨ AI analyzes entire codebase for vulnerabilities
# ✨ Identifies security risks across OWASP Top 10 categories
# ✨ Generates comprehensive audit report
# ✨ Provides code examples and remediation steps
# ✅ Report saved to /docs/security with timestamp
```

## 🤖 Available Agents

## 💡 Features

### `/security-init` Command

#### Intelligent Technology Detection

Automatically detects your project's technology stack by scanning for indicator files:

- **Node.js**: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- **Python**: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `poetry.lock`
- **.NET**: `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `global.json`
- **Go**: `go.mod`, `go.sum`
- **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`
- **PHP**: `composer.json`, `composer.lock`
- **Ruby**: `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`
- **Java**: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`
- **Docker**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`

#### Comprehensive File Denial Patterns

Builds an intelligent deny list with 40-60+ patterns covering:

**Security Essentials:**
- Environment files (all `.env` variants)
- Credentials and secrets files
- SSH keys and certificates (`.pem`, `.key`, `id_rsa`, etc.)
- Cloud provider configs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Database files (`.db`, `.sqlite`)

**Technology-Specific Patterns:**
- **Python**: `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
- **.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `.vs/`, `TestResults/`
- **Node.js**: `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `dist/`, `.turbo/`
- **Go**: `vendor/`
- **Rust**: `target/`
- **PHP**: `vendor/`
- **Ruby**: `vendor/bundle/`, `.bundle/`
- **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `.gradle/`

**Version Control & IDE:**
- `.git/**`, `.vscode/**`, `.idea/**`
- `.devcontainer/**`, `.github/workflows/**`

#### Smart Merge Strategies

When `.claude/settings.json` already exists, you can choose how to merge:

- **Deduplicate** (default): Remove duplicate patterns, add only new ones
- **Append**: Add all new patterns, keep any duplicates
- **Replace**: Completely replace existing deny section

#### Preview & Confirmation

Before making any changes, see:
- Technologies detected
- Current configuration (if exists)
- All new patterns grouped by category
- Total patterns before/after merge
- Merge strategy being used

## ⚙️ How It Works

The `/security-audit` command uses Claude Code's specialized **security-auditor agent** to perform comprehensive security analysis:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Scans source files for security anti-patterns
   - Analyzes authentication and authorization flows
   - Reviews configuration files for misconfigurations
   - Checks dependency packages for known vulnerabilities

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identifies SQL injection vectors
   - Detects XSS vulnerabilities
   - Finds authentication bypass opportunities
   - Locates hardcoded secrets
   - Checks for missing authorization

3. **Report Generation**
   - Categorizes findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Provides exact locations with file paths and line numbers
   - Includes code examples and remediation guidance
   - Creates prioritized remediation roadmap
   - Saves timestamped report to /docs/security folder

The specialized agent brings deep security expertise and pattern recognition capabilities to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual review.

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Run Security Audits

- ✅ Before production deployments
- ✅ After implementing authentication/authorization features
- ✅ When adding new API endpoints
- ✅ After integrating third-party libraries
- ✅ During security reviews and compliance checks
- ✅ As part of CI/CD pipeline (automated security gates)

### How to Use Audit Results

1. **Prioritize Critical & High findings** - Address these immediately
2. **Review code context** - Understand why each finding is a risk
3. **Apply remediation examples** - Use provided code fixes as templates
4. **Test fixes thoroughly** - Ensure security patches don't break functionality
5. **Re-audit after fixes** - Verify vulnerabilities are resolved

---

## ⏱️ Time Savings

**Per security audit:**

- Manual security review: ~4-8 hours (for medium-sized codebase)
- With security-audit: ~2-3 minutes (AI-powered analysis)

**Estimated savings:**

- Per comprehensive audit: Save ~4-8 hours
- Per month (2 audits): Save ~8-16 hours
- Per year: Save ~100+ hours

Plus reduced security incident risk and faster vulnerability remediation.
