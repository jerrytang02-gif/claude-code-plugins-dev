- With ai-ado (Manual Mode): ~5-10 minutes (follows conventions automatically)
- **With ai-ado (AI Mode): ~2-4 minutes** (AI generates content, you just review and confirm)

**Estimated savings with AI Mode:**

- Per sprint (3 feature sets): Save ~2.5-3 hours
- Per quarter: Save ~30-36 hours
- Per year: Save ~120-144 hours

**Additional benefits:**

- **AI-Generated Quality**: Professional, well-structured work items every time
- **Consistent Standards**: AI follows your naming conventions and formatting rules
- **Reduced Mental Load**: Focus on what to build, not how to write work items
- **Better Acceptance Criteria**: AI generates comprehensive Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members get professional work items without training
- **Fewer Mistakes**: AI handles hierarchy, HTML formatting, and field requirements
- **Better Backlog**: Consistent organization and priority sorting

## 🔧 Configuration

### MCP Server Setup

The `/ado-init` command can optionally create a `.mcp.json` file to configure the Microsoft Azure DevOps MCP server.

**Windows Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ado": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "YOUR_ORGANIZATION"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Linux/Mac Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ado": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "YOUR_ORGANIZATION"]
    }
  }
}
```

**How it works:**

- Asks if you're using Windows or Linux/Mac for correct command format
- If `.mcp.json` doesn't exist, it will be created with your organization name and OS-specific command
- If `.mcp.json` already exists, you'll get a manual configuration snippet to add (for security reasons, existing files are not read or modified)
- Uses `npx` to run the MCP server without requiring global installation
- Windows requires `cmd /c` prefix for proper npx execution

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 20 or higher must be installed for `npx` to work
- Check your version: `node --version`

**Security Note:**

For security reasons, the plugin will not read or modify existing `.mcp.json` files. If you already have this file, the command will show you the OS-appropriate configuration snippet to manually add.

### Authentication

First-time use of Azure DevOps MCP tools will open a browser for Microsoft account authentication. Credentials must match your Azure DevOps organization access.
