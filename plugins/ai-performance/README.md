## 🎯 What This Plugin Does

Provides a complete suite of AI-powered performance tools including commands, agents, and skills that help you build high-performance applications, detect bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and maintain performance best practices throughout your development lifecycle.

### 🔍 Important: What This Plugin Is (and Isn't)

**This is a DEVELOPER-FOCUSED CODE ANALYSIS TOOL** designed to help developers with codebase access identify performance issues during development.

#### ✅ What This Plugin IS:
- **Static code analysis tool** for developers working with source code
- **Performance anti-pattern detection** for N+1 queries, inefficient loops, blocking operations
- **Developer education tool** with optimization guidance and code examples
- **Complementary tool** to augment your performance workflow
- **Early detection system** to catch performance issues before they reach production

#### ❌ What This Plugin IS NOT:
- **NOT a replacement for runtime performance monitoring** or Application Performance Monitoring (APM) platforms
- **NOT a load testing tool** (doesn't execute code or simulate traffic)
- **NOT a complete performance solution** (catches code-level issues, not infrastructure/runtime issues)
- **NOT a substitute for profiling tools** that measure actual execution time
- **NOT a replacement for real user monitoring (RUM)** or synthetic monitoring services
- **NOT a browser performance testing tool** (doesn't measure Core Web Vitals in browsers)

#### 🎯 How This Fits Into Your Performance Workflow:

**Best Practice**: Use this plugin during development to catch code-level performance issues early, then validate with profiling tools, load testing, and production monitoring.

### Why Use This Plugin?

While you can manually review code for performance issues, this plugin provides structured, comprehensive performance analysis:

❌ **Manual performance review challenges:**
- No standardized analysis methodology
- Inconsistent performance documentation
- Difficult to track improvements over time
- Hard to prioritize optimization efforts

This plugin enhances performance analysis by providing:

✅ **Custom analysis templates** - Define exactly what your audit should cover
✅ **Controlled output location** - Reports saved to `/docs/performance/{timestamp}-performance-audit.md` (timestamp prevents overwrites)
✅ **Reproducible audits** - Same comprehensive format every time
✅ **Standardized documentation** - Consistent audit reports across all projects
✅ **Timestamped tracking** - Easy to compare audits and measure improvements over time
✅ **Enterprise-ready** - Professional audit documents suitable for performance reviews

**Use this plugin for:** Formal performance audits, optimization planning, and repeatable performance assessments

## 📋 Available Commands

### `/performance-audit`
