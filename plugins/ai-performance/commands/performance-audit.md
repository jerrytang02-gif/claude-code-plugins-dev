## Code Optimization Examples

### N+1 Query Fix

**Before (Inefficient)**:

```csharp
var vendors = context.Vendors.ToList();
foreach (var vendor in vendors)
{
    vendor.Products = context.Products.Where(p => p.VendorId == vendor.Id).ToList();
}
```

**After (Optimized)**:

```csharp
var vendors = context.Vendors
    .Include(v => v.Products)
    .ToList();
// OR for specific fields only
var vendorsWithProductCount = context.Vendors
    .Select(v => new VendorViewModel
    {
        Id = v.Id,
        Name = v.Name,
        ProductCount = v.Products.Count()
    })
    .ToList();
```

### Async/Await Implementation

**Before (Blocking)**:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult GetVendors()
{
    var vendors = vendorService.GetAll(); // Synchronous call
    return Ok(vendors);
}
```

**After (Non-blocking)**:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetVendors()
{
    var vendors = await vendorService.GetAllAsync(); // Asynchronous call
    return Ok(vendors);
}
```

### Caching Implementation

**Before (No Caching)**:

```csharp
public List<Category> GetCategories()
{
    return context.Categories.OrderBy(c => c.Name).ToList();
}
```

**After (With Caching)**:

```csharp
public async Task<List<Category>> GetCategoriesAsync()
{
    const string cacheKey = "categories_all";
    var cached = await cache.GetAsync<List<Category>>(cacheKey);
    if (cached != null)
        return cached;

    var categories = await context.Categories
        .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    await cache.SetAsync(cacheKey, categories, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30));
    return categories;
}
```
